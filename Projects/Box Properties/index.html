        Part of Paris, Banks of the Seine Criteria Cultural: i, ii, iv Reference 600 Inscription 1991 (15th Session) The
        Eiffel Tower.The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,[7] about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the
        tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its
        construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in
        the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It
        was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height. Due to the
        addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building
        by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in
        France after the Millau Viaduct.</p>
